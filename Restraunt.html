			Tacos 'n' Food is not just any restaurant; it is made from the heart.  This is the very epitome of a "mom and pop" store: my wife is the only waitress, while I am the only chef!
				Because of this, we take every order seriously.  Our 2-person restaurant knows how to handle tacos from our many nights out as teenagers going to Taco Bell, and we have honed our skills
				with their taste as our starting line.  In my humble opinion, we have exceeded their skill with both taste, and unhealthiness.  I do not say this lightly.  When you dine here, you should have the next
				day off.  We take seriously the art of making tacos, and since we realize that not everyone loves tacos, we also studied how to make more classic American dishes to accommodate everyone who comes 
				through our doors.
